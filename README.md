# Python Data Visualization 
## Overview
Visualization helps in understanding complex data patterns easily. Two of the most popular libraries for data visualization in Python are matplotlib and seaborn.

## matplotlib
Matplotlib is a powerful plotting library in Python. It allows you to create a wide variety of static, animated, and interactive visualizations. With matplotlib, you can:
- `Create basic plots like line charts, bar charts, and scatter plots`
- `Customize your plots with titles, labels, and legends`
- `Save your visualizations in different formats (PNG, PDF, etc.)`

## seaborn
Seaborn is built on top of matplotlib and makes it easier to create beautiful and informative statistical plots. It has built-in themes and color palettes to make plots more visually appealing. With seaborn, you can:
- `Visualize the distribution of data`
- `Create complex visualizations like heatmaps and pair plots`
- `Combine and enhance matplotlib plots with less effort`
