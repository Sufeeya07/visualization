# Python Data Visualization Project
## Overview
Visualization helps in understanding complex data patterns easily. Two of the most popular libraries for data visualization in Python are matplotlib and seaborn.

## matplotlib
matplotlib is a powerful plotting library in Python. It allows you to create a wide variety of static, animated, and interactive visualizations. With matplotlib, you can:
Create basic plots like line charts, bar charts, and scatter plots
Customize your plots with titles, labels, and legends
Save your visualizations in different formats (PNG, PDF, etc.)

## seaborn
seaborn is built on top of matplotlib and makes it easier to create beautiful and informative statistical plots. It has built-in themes and color palettes to make plots more visually appealing. With seaborn, you can:
Visualize the distribution of data
Create complex visualizations like heatmaps and pair plots
Combine and enhance matplotlib plots with less effort
